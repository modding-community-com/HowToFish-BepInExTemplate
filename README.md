## Installing

.NET templates must be installed before they can be used. This means that when you install the template, it doesn't create a new project for you, but now you have the ability to do that.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use .NET SDK 10 or newer to use this template. You can check your .NET SDK version by running the following in a terminal: `dotnet --version`. To download .NET SDK, see: <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>

### From NuGet (Recommended)

Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new install ModdingCommunity.HowToFish-BepInExTemplate
```

> [!TIP]  
> You can run `dotnet new update` to update all your dotnet templates. You should do this get the latest versions of everything with the latest fixes and improvements!

### Manually

If you're contributing to the template or prefer a manual installation:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open a terminal at the root of the repository
3. Run:

```bash
dotnet new install .
```

To update:

```bash
dotnet new install . --force
```

To uninstall:

```bash
dotnet new uninstall .
```

Once installed, the template will be available as `How to Fish BepInEx Plugin` with an alias `htfmod`.

## Creating a Project

Before creating a project, take a look at the available options so you are aware of what can be customized:

| Short Flag | Long Flag            | Description                                                     | Required | Type | Default             |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| -g         | --guid               | The global identifier for your mod. Example: AuthorName.ModName | true     | text |                     |
| -tt        | --ts-team            | The thunderstore team to publish this package under.            | false    | text | TODO_team_name_here |
| -nt        | --no-tutorial        | If true, tutorial comments will not be present.                 | false    | bool | false               |
| -li        | --library            | If true, NuGet metadata is included in the project.             | false    | bool | false               |
| -ig        | --inverted-gitignore | Gitignore ignores everything and specifies what to include.     | false    | bool | false               |

You can run `dotnet new htfmod --help` to see all available options.

Now that you are ready to create a project, open a terminal in your How to Fish modding directory, and run the following, including any options of your choice:

> [!NOTE]  
> You should [set up a Thunderstore team first](<https://thunderstore.io/settings/teams/create/>) so you can use its name in the optional `--ts-team` argument so the template can give you a mostly correctly configured packaging setup.

```sh
dotnet new htfmod --output ModName --guid AuthorName.ModName --ts-team YourThunderstoreTeam
```

This will create a new directory with the mod name which contains the project.

You now have a (mostly) working setup. See [Setting Up The Config File](#setting-up-the-config-file) and [Thunderstore Packaging \& Publishing](#thunderstore-packaging--publishing) for more.

### Project Structure

This example demonstrates what files should appear and where:

```sh
~/Workspace/HowToFish$ dotnet new htfmod --output MyCoolMod --guid modding-community-com.MyCoolMod --ts-team modding-community-com
The template "HowToFish BepInEx Plugin" was created successfully.

~/Workspace/HowToFish$ cd MyCoolMod/
~/Workspace/HowToFish/MyCoolMod$ tree

3 directories, 11 files
```

- `./src/<project-name>/` contains the C# source files for your mod
  - `<project-name>.csproj` is the C# project configuration file, which builds a `dll` file
  - `Plugin.cs` is the C# source code file which defines your BepInEx plugin class
- `./` contains project configuration files
  - `Directory.Build.*` files contain shared configuration for all projects in subdirectories
  - `Config.Build.user.props.template` is a template file for per-user configuration (see [Setting Up The Config File](#setting-up-the-config-file))
  - `<project-name>.slnx` is file which defines which `csproj` files are included in your project
  - `global.json` informs your dev tools of the minimum supported .NET SDK version for the project
  - `CHANGELOG.md`, `icon.png`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` are placeholder files which are to be modified by you
    - These are included in your Thunderstore package, which is configured in `./src/<project-name>/<project-name>.csproj`

The project is configured so that it's easy to add new projects into your project solution. Even if you don't need that, it's a good idea to follow a standard project structure in case a need ever comes, or just so that everything is where you'd expect it to be. For example, does your project need automated tests? Copy your `./src/<project-name>/` plugin's `csproj` and `Plugin.cs` to `./tests/<project-name>.Tests/`, add the new `csproj` to your `slnx` project, and start working on your test project.

### Setting Up The Config File

At the root of your new project you should see `Config.Build.user.props.template` this is a special file that is the template for the project's user-specific config. Make a copy of this file and rename it `Config.Build.user.props` without the template part.

This file will copy your assembly files to a plugins directory and it can be used to configure your paths to the game files and BepInEx plugins directory if the defaults don't work for you.

### Thunderstore Packaging & Publishing

This template comes with Thunderstore packaging built-in, using [ThunderPipe](<https://github.com/WarperSan/ThunderPipe>). You should configure the `src/<project-name>/<project-name>.csproj` file with the Thunderstore metadata for your mod.

You can build Thunderstore packages by building with release configuration:

```sh
dotnet build -c Release -v d
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You can learn about different build options with `dotnet build --help`.  
> `-c` is short for `--configuration` and `-v d` is `--verbosity detailed`.

The built package will be found at `./artifacts/thunderstore/`.

You can directly publish to Thunderstore by including `-p:PublishTS=true` in the command. See the `Config.Build.user.props.template` file for configuration instructions.

### Publishing via GitHub Actions

This template doesn't support GitHub actions publishing due to a lack of GameLibs package for the game.
